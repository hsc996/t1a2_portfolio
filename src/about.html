                    My name is Hannah, an enthusiastic software developer deeply intrigued by the opportunity to devise inventive solutions for tangible issues. Since my youth, I've been intruiged by the realm of technology and its profound capacity to revolutionise lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently pursuing a Higher Education Diploma with Coder Academy, where Iâ€™ve learned to advance my skills in programming languages like HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, JsNode and React. Within this program, I have also been able to delve into concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and software design principles.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    I thrive in collaborative environments and love bouncing ideas off fellow developers to create elegant, efficient code. Whether through hackathons, group projects, or open-source contributions, I'm always eager to learn from others and share my own insights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What truly drives me is the opportunity to make a positive impact through technology. Whether it's developing software that enhances accessibility, improves efficiency, or fosters connectivity, I'm committed to using my skills to create meaningful solutions that benefit society as a whole.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, you can find me immersing myself in the latest tech trends, exploring new programming languages or frameworks, or simply unwinding with a good book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's connect and build something incredible together!
