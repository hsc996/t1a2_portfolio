# T1A2 Portfolio Assessment

## Sitemap

Below is a written version of the sitemap I devised for the website prior to commencing.
The main pages are listed with '+' signs, and will each be connected by a navigation bar in the header of every page.
The subheadings listed with the '>' icon symbolise links/buttons that will navigate to another page.
Please see the Sitemap attached for the visual representation of how to navigate the website.
